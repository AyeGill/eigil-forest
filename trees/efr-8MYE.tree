    The support of #{p: X \to A} is equipped with a canonical deterministic monomorphism #{S_p \into A}, so that a map into #{A} is absolutely continuous with respect to #{p} if and only if it factors over the support.

  \li{Two maps #{A \otimes W \to B} are #{p}-almost surely equal if and only if they are strictly equal on the support.}
