  Let #{\cD \to \cC} be a Markov fibration. Then we may form the completion of #{\cD \times_\cC \cC_{\det} \to \cC_{\det}.} By the universal property, there is a canonical induced functor #{\bar{\cD} \to \cD}.
  We say the Markov fibration #{\cD} [[todo-tree]] FIND A GOOD TERM if this is an isomorphism of categories (note that it is automatically bijective on objects).
