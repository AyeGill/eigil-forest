\taxon{theorem}
\p{
  Let #{T\RR^n \lensto *}, represented by #{A: C^\infty(\RR) \to C(\RR)}, be the dynamical system corresponding to a stochastic differential equation #{dX_t = \mu(X_t)dt + \sigma(X)dW_t}.
}
\p{
  Then a chart of systems (TODO: clock system notation) #{ \to \RR^n} is equivalently a Markov process which solves the SDE.
