\p{
  Let #{(\cC, \cA, T)} be a stochastic dynamical systems theory. Consider the double category whose vertical category is #{\cC_\det} and horizontal category is #{\cC}, with commutative squares as the 2-cells (this is the \em{transpose} of #{\MAr{\cC} \rightrightarrows \cC}). This carries an obvious symmetric monoidal structure, and acts on the double category of stochastic arenas #{\widetile{\Arena}(\cA)} via the functor #{T}. Denote by #{\BiSys^M(\cC,\cA,T)} the symmetric monoidal triple category induced as in \ref{efr-EPI9} by this data.
