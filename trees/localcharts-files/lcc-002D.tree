  The forgetful functor #{\Minmax \to \Set^\Delta \times \Set^{\Delta,\op}} is a monoidal fibration, in the sense of \ref{shulman-monfibs}, (see also \ref{moeller-vasilakopoulou}). It is also a monoidal opfibration - in other words, both the classes of Cartesian and coCartesian maps are stable under tensor product.
