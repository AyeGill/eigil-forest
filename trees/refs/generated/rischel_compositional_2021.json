Yet, it is difficult to formalise how we may change the underlying variables used to describe the system, say moving from fine-grained to coarse-grained variables. Here, we argue that compositionality is a desideratum for such model transformations and the associated errors: When abstracting a reference model M iteratively, first obtaining M\u2019 and then further simplifying that to obtain M\u201d, we expect the composite transformation from M to M\u201d to exist and its error to be bounded by the errors incurred by each individual transformation step.
