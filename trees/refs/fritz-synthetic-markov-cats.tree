We develop Markov categories as a framework for synthetic probability and statistics, following work of Golubtsov as well as Cho and Jacobs. This means that we treat the following concepts in purely abstract categorical terms: conditioning and disintegration; various versions of conditional independence and its standard properties; conditional products; almost surely; suï¬ƒcient statistics; as well as versions of theorems on suï¬ƒcient statistics due to Fisherâ€“Neyman, Basu, and Bahadur. Besides the conceptual clarity oï¬€ered by our categorical setup, its main advantage is that it provides a uniform treatment of various types of probability theory, including discrete probability theory, measure-theoretic probability with general measurable spaces, Gaussian probability, Markov processes of either of these kinds, and many others.
