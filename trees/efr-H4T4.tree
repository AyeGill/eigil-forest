  Let #{\cC} be a model category. We say #{\cC} is \em{quasi-Cisinski} if there exist a family of functors #{F_i: \cC \to \Set}, each of which preserve colimits, and which \em{jointly detect cofibrations} in the sense that #{f: X \to Y \in \cC} is a cofibration if and only if each #{F_if : F_iX \to F_iY} is an injection.
