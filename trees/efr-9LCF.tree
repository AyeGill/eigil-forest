  As discussed above, #{\Act(\Cat)} is the locally full subcategory of the 2-category of actegories and pairs of strong monoidal and lax linear functors constructed in \ref{actegories-amthematician-capucci-gavranovic} (see Proposition 3.6.5) spanned by the pseudolinear (or "strongly linear") functors.
