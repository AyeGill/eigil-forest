\p{
  There exists a (strong) symmetric monoidal functor #{\Optic(Kl(\Delta)) \to \SLens(\MAr{Kl(\Delta)})} which
  \ol{
    \li{Is fully faithful.}
    \li{Preserves the good coproducts.}
    \li{So that the image has all coproducts, and every object of the image is a coproduct of objects in #{\Optic(Kl(\Delta))}}
    \li{And so that moreover the monoidal structure on the image is distributive}
