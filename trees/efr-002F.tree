\title{The theory of discrete dynamical systems}
\taxon{example}
\p{
  There is a theory of dynamical systems with category of spaces #{\cC = \Set}, category of bundles #{\cA(X) = \Set_{/X}} (with pullbacks for reindexing), and tangent bundle #{TX = X \times X \xto{\pi_0} X}.
  We call this the theory of \em{discrete dynamical systems}. (In the sense that they are both discrete-time and discrete-space).
