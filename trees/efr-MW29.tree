\taxon{Lemma}
\p{
  If #{\cC} is representable and positive, #{\cC_\det} has limits, and the monad #{P} preserves intersections, then #{\cC} is pullback-positive.
}
\proof{
  \p{
    This is clear, since if the monad #{P} preserves a given limit, so does the inclusion into the Kleisli category (for completely abstract reasons), hence by \ref{efr-0YP1} we are done.
  }
