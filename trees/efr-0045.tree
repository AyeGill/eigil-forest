\p{
  Markov categories generally do not have pullbacks, for the same reason that they usually don't have products. This issue generally hinders the construction of fibrations, in the ordinary sense, of Markov categories. However, we can go part of the way. the following definitions is that given a pullback in the deterministic category, say #{A \times_Y X}, a map #{P \to A \times_Y X} \em{where the #{X}-coordinate is deterministic} should be uniquely determined by a choice of (deterministic) map #{P \to X} and (nondeterministic) #{P \to A} such that the square commutes. The analogous statement for products - that a map #{P \to A \otimes X} with deterministic #{X}-component is uniquely determined by the projections (or marginals) #{P \to X, P \to A} - is a consequence of the \em{positivity} axiom (see Fritz...), and hence holds in most Markov categories of interest.
