\p{
  Let #{\cC} be a #{\kappa}-distributive externally iterable coinflip Markov category. There is an essentially unique #{\kappa}-coproduct preserving Markov functor #{F: \Set^{< \kappa} \to \cC} (since #{\cC_\det} is #{\kappa}-distributive and #{\Set^{< \kappa}} is initial such). Any extension to the stochastic morphisms is determined by its action on the homsets #{\Set_{\bar{\Delta}}^{< \kappa}(*,X) = \bar{\Delta}(X)}, by the coproduct universal property. On these its action must be given by taking a convex combination #{\sum_i \epsilon_i x_i} to the convex combination #{\sum_i \epsilon_i F(x_i)}. This is functorial by \ref{efr-REOY}, finishing the proof.
