\title{Midpoint algebra and Coinflips}

\p{
    We will not have any hope of giving a universal property for #{\BorelStoch}, or any interesting Markov category, without some property that forces certain maps to be nondeterministic. We now give such a structure.

  \p{
    Note that any coinflip structure is determined by the family of maps #{m(\pi_0,\pi_1) : A \otimes A \to A}. To define a coinflip structure, such a family #{\mu_A} must satisfy the equations of a midpoint algebra, be natural in #{A}, and have the further property that #{\mu_A f = \mu_A (\pi_0 f, \pi_1 f)} (that is, the composite depends only on the projections of #{f}).
  }
  \p{
    It is not clear that coinflip structures are preserved by all Markov functors, since #{F(\mu_A)} only has to enjoy the above property with respect to maps in the image of #{F}. However, as we now show, this is true in the distributive case.

  \p{
    Note that any coinflip #{I \to I + I} in a distributive Markov category induces a coinflip structure, and vice versa. Since both notions are unique, this is obviously a 1-1 correspondence. From this we easily derive the following:

    In this case we might call #{u} an \em{iteration operator} for #{s}.

  \p{
    The situation with coinflip Markov categories is similar to the situation of preadditive categories, known for example from the study of homological algebra. Under mild conditions on a category (admitting finite products and coproducts is sufficient), an enrichment over commutative monoids is unique if it exists.
