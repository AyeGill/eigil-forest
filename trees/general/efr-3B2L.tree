  #{\Markov_{\bool, \omega}^{\flip}} is the 2-category where objects are Markov categories which have a [coinflip](efr-0XH9), which are [countably extensive](efr-B2P7), admit countable [kolmogorov products](efr-EB3U), where #{\cC_\det} is Boolean. The functors are strong monoidal Markov functors which preserve countable limits in #{\cC_\det} and countable coproducts.
