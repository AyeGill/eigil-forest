Suppose #{\cC} has conditionals. Then #{\cC^\to \to \cC} is a Markov fibration. Moreover, let #{\cD \to \cC} be some other Markov fibration,
and let #{F: \cC^\to|_\det \to \cD|_\det} be a functor over #{\cC_\det} which preserves Cartesian morphisms. Then there is a unique extension of #{F} to a functor #{\cC^\to \to \cD}.
