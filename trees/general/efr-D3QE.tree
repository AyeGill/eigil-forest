\title{Proof of \ref{efr-TVLB}}
\p{
  Using \ref{efr-VH33}, there is a unique functor #{F: \Borel_{\bar{\Delta}} \to \cC}.
  There is a faithful (identity on objects) functor #{\Borel_{\bar{\Delta}} \to \BorelStoch} - the only case where this is not full is #{\Hom(A,2^\omega)}.
}
\p{
  It is apparent that we must extend this functor by defining #{\bar{F}(\phi: A \to 2^\omega) = \lim_n F(\pi_{2^n}\phi)}, using the universal property of #{F(2^\omega) = F(2)^\omega}. The only question is whether this extension is actually functorial. By the limit property it suffices to prove that it is functorial for any composable pair
  ##{A \xto{\phi} 2^\omega \xto{\psi} K}
  with #{K} finite.
}
\p{
  Let a function #{f: 2^\omega \to K} be \em{good} if #{\bar{F}(\phi) ; F(f) = F(\phi ; f)} for all kernels #{\phi: A \to 2^\omega} (for all #{A}).
  Let an algebra of sets #{\AA \subseteq \cB(2^\omega)} (i.e a collection of subsets stable under finite unions and complements) be called good if every #{\AA}-measurable map #{2^\omega \to K} to a finite set is good. Now we claim:
}
\ol{
  \li{
    The class #{\AA_0} of sets of the form #{V \times 2^\omega} for #{V \subseteq 2^N}, #{N} finite, is a good algebra.
  }
  \li{
    If #{\AA} is a good algebra, let #{\AA^+} be the smallest algebra containing all countable unions of sets in #{\AA}. Then #{\AA^+} is again a good algebra.
  }
  \li{
    Any directed union of good algebras #{\AA_0 \subseteq \AA_1 \dots \subseteq A_\alpha \subseteq} is again a good algebra. 
  }
}
\p{
  First note that, by Zorn's lemma, this straightforwardly implies the full Borel #{\sigma}-algebra is a good algebra, which in turn concludes the proof.
}
\p{
  Point 3 holds, since both being an algebra and being good are finitary properties (any map to a finite set which is measurable for the union must be measurable at some finite stage).
  Point 1 is a straightforward consequence of the fact that the projections #{2^\omega \to 2^N} are good by construction. So we are left with point 2.
}
\p{
  Let #{\AA} be a good algebra. Let us identify sets by their indicators #{2^\omega \to 2}. Then we can write any set in #{\AA^+} as
  ##{g(\vee(f_1^i(-)), \vee f_2^i(-), \dots , \vee f_k^i(-)),}
  where #{g: 2^k \to 2} is some function, #{\vee : 2^\omega \to 2} is the indicator of the sequences with at least one #{1}, and #{f_j^i, 0 \leq j \leq k, 0 \leq i < \infty} are a bunch of #{\AA}-measurable functions.
}
\p{
  By assumption the pairing of all the #{f}'s, #{2^\omega \to (2^\omega)^k} is good, and so it suffices to show that the mapping #{(\vee)^k : (2^\omega)^k \to 2^k} is good.
  By induction we may suppose this holds for #{(\vee)^{k-1}}, since it is trivial for #{k=0}.
}
\p{
  Now let #{\phi: A \to (2^\omega)^k} be some kernel. Write #{A = A_0 + A_1}, where #{A_0} is the subset where the probability of only zeroes in the first stream is at least #{1/2}, and #{A_1} is the complement, where the probability of at least one #{1} in the first stream is #{>1/2}. Observe that by #{\sigma}-continuity, for each #{a} there must be some #{N} so that the probability of at least one #{1} in the first #{N} elements of the first stream is at least #{1/2}. Decompose #{A_1} into #{A_1^1 +  A_1^2 +  \cdots,} where for #{a \in A_1^N} there is at least a #{1/2} probability of the first #{1} being before #{N}. Let #{\psi_1 : A \to (2^\omega)^k} be a kernel which on #{A_0} is given by #{(0, \otimes \mu_{2\dots k})} where #{\mu_{2,\dots k}} is the kernel giving the conditional distribution of the remaining streams if the first stream is #{0}. On #{A_1^N}, it is given by a linear combination #{\sum_{s \in 2^N \setminus 0} \delta_{s} \otimes \mu_s}, where #{\mu_s} is the conditional distribution of the rest of the stream and the remaining streams - we choose this linear combination so that #{1/2} of it is #{\leq} the actual probability of each of those prefixes.
}
\p{
  Thus we obtain a decomposition of #{\phi} as #{\sum_i \frac{1}{2^i} \phi_i} where for each #{\phi_i}, the distribution on the first coordinate is either concentrated on #{0 \in 2^\omega}, or concentrated away from #{0} on some finite prefix. Each of these satisfy #{F(\vee^k)\bar{F}(\phi_i) = F(\vee^k \phi_i)}. Hence, since #{F(\vee^k)} must preserve the infinite linear combination, #{\vee^k} must be good as desired.

\todo{Why does it suffice to check measurable functions? I think this has something to do with randomness pushback.}
\todo{Exactly how does the induction on k work?}
