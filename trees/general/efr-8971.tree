  Let #{\cC, \cD} be Markov categories. A functor #{F: \cC \to \cD} admits an oplax Markov structure if and only if it preserves deterministic maps and independent pairings. If it does, the oplax structure is given by the unique such structure on #{\cC_\det \to \cD_\det} induced by these being Cartesian.
