\p{
  Any iterable midpoint algebra carries the structure of an algebra of #{\bar{\Delta}}.
  Moreover any midpoint homomorphism between iterable midpoint algebras is a #{\bar{\Delta}}-homomorphism. In particular, if #{\cC} is an externally iterable coinflip Markov category, each homset #{\cC(X,Y)} is a #{\bar{\Delta}}-algebra, and composition is biconvex (i.e convex in each variable separately). If #{\cC \to \cD} is a functor between externally iterable coinflip Markov categories, it automatically preserves this structure.
