  If a category has coproducts, then #{\Set} acts on it via #{S \cdot X = \coprod_{s \in S}X}. (This is the #{\Set}-enriched case of what in enriched categories is called a \em{copower} or \em{tensor}, the dual of the power objects from \ref{efr-K3YI}). The morphisms of #{\Para_\Set(\cC)} are pairs #{(I \in \Set, (f_i: X \to Y \in \cC)_{i \in I})}, which compose in the obvious way.

  Note that this definition clearly makes sense even if #{\cC} does not actually have coproducts. This is an example of another construction which has been called #{\Para}, which takes a monoidal category #{\cV} and a #{\cV}-enriched category #{\cC} and constructs a double category where the morphisms are pairs #{(J \in \cV, J \to \cC(X,Y))}. It is not hard to see that this also extends to a double category in the same way, but we do not presently know the correct definition of \em{internal enriched object} that would replace pseudomonoid actions to replicate our general theory for this case. (note that the literature contains a notion of \em{internal enriched category}, \ref{internal-enriched}, but these are categories enriched over \em{internal monoidal categories}---hat is, the ambient category #{\cE} is a 1-category and the categorical structure of the base of enrichment #{\cV} is formulated on top of this, not as part of the structure of the objects of the category #{\cE})
