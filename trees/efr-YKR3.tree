  Of course, there is an equally good "pull-back" operation on selection relations given by #{\{(x,kf) \mid (fx, k)\}} (this is the pushforward in #{\SS_{\cC^\op}}). These do not bear any particular relation to each other -- they do not appear to be adjoint. In both cases, the existential qualification involved in their definition is a little awkward, and they should possibly be replaced by the functor into #{\dblCat} -- that is, categories and profunctors, where we say two equilibrium relations #{\epsilon \in \SS_X, \epsilon' \in \SS_Y} are related by #{f :X \to Y} if #{\epsilon(x, kf) \Rightarrow \epsilon'(fx, k)}.

  However, we will stick with the pushforward definition for now.
