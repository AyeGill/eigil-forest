  Of course, there is an equally good "pull-back" operation on selection relations given by #{\{(x,kf) \mid (fx, k)\}} (this is the pushforward in #{\SS_{\cC^\op}}). These are adjoint representatives of the same profunctor, which should arguably be regarded as the primary object of interest - that is, we could work with a functor #{\cC \to \dblCat}, the category of categories and profunctors, where we say two selection relations #{\epsilon \in \SS_X, \epsilon' \in \SS_Y} are related by #{f :X \to Y} if #{\epsilon(x, kf) \Rightarrow \epsilon'(fx, k)}.

  However, we will stick with the pushforward definition for now, since it is conceptually simpler and good enough for our purposes.
