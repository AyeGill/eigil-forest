\p{
  Let #{\cM} be a monoidal category. Then an action of #{\cM} is equivalently a bifunctor #{C: B\cM \to \Cat}, where #{C(*)} is the category which this is an action on.
}
\p{
  The 2-Grothendieck construction of such a bifunctor, #{\int C \to B\cM,} is exactly the locally graded #{\cM}-category corresponding to the action.
