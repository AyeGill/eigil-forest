\p{
  By construction, for each Markov prefibration #{\cD,} there is a canonical functor #{\SChart(\cD|_\det) \to \cD} over #{\cC}, which restricts to an isomorphism on the deterministic part (and in particular preserves Cartesian morphisms). #{\cD} is a Markov fibration if and only if this is an isomorphism.
}
\p{
  Also by construction, given a morphism of stochastic modules #{F: \cD_0 \to \cD_0',} there is an induced functor #{\SChart(\cD) \to \SChart(\cD')} over #{\cC}. This restricts to #{F} on the deterministic part and in particular preserves Cartesian morphisms.
