\p{
  Let #{\cD} be a stochastic module over #{\cC}. There is a double category #{\widetilde{\Span}(\cD)^\chart} which has decorated spans as its horizontal maps, morphisms in #{\cD|_\det} as its vertical maps, and decorated span 2-cells as its 2-cells.
}
\p{
  Moreover, there is another double category #{\widetilde{\Span}(\cD)^\lens} which has decorated spans \em{in #{\cD^\fop}} as its horizontal maps instead.
