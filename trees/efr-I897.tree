\p{
  Let #{\CC} be a 2-category which admits pullbacks, products and comma objects.
  Then there is a functor #{\dblPara: \Act(\CC) \to \PsCat(\CC)} from the 2-category of pseudomonoid actions and pseudolinear maps to the 2-category of pseudocategories and pseudofunctors. This functor preserves strict maps, limits, and filtered colimits.
