\title{The theory of stochastic discrete dynamical systems}
\p{
  There is a systems theory where #{\cC = \Set, \cA(X) = Kl(\Delta)^X} (with the evident reindexing maps) and #{T(X) = X \times X}.
}
\p{
  In this theory, a closed dynamical system is a set equipped with a map #{X \to \Delta(X)}. An open dynamical system has stochastic \em{update} function, but output which depends deterministically on the current system state.
