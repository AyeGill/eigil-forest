  Let #{\cC} be any category, and let #{\cC^\to} denote the arrow category. Then the codomain functor #{\cC^\to \to \cC} is a fibration if and only if #{\cC} admits all pullbacks, and in this case the functors #{f^*: \cC_Y \to \cC_X,} given #{f: X \to Y,} are given by pullback along #{f}.
}

  The functors #{f^*} are sometimes referred to as \em{pullback}, a convention we generally adopt. They are also sometimes called \em{base-change} functors.
