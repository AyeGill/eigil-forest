Given #{\cD_0 \to \cC_\det \to \cC}, we think of a Markov fibration over #{\cC} with this universal property as being generated by #{\cD_0}. We will also intepret these as \em{stochastic charts}, in the sense of categorical systems theory, for this fibration. \ref{efr-0049} is a sort of consistency result which tells us that this notion recovers something reasonable in the simple case of a codomain Markov fibration, at least if #{\cC} has conditionals. The conditionals are used both to decompose the stochastic map on the top into two "phases" (first we generate the base, then the element in the fiber conditional on that), and to prove that any two such are equal. However, it is not clear whether conditionals are a necessary condition.
