However, decision-makers are often faced with multiple related problems and multi-scale observations where joint formulations are needed in order to efficiently exploit the problem structures and data dependencies. Transfer learning for {CMABs} addresses the situation where models are defined on identical variables, although causal connections may differ. In this work, we extend transfer learning to setups involving {CMABs} defined on potentially different variables, with varying degrees of granularity, and related via an abstraction map.

Our key novelty is the introduction of error credits, a separation logic resource that tracks the error bound of a program. By representing error bounds as a resource, we recover the benefits of separation logic, including compositionality, modularity, and dependency between errors and program terms, allowing for more precise specifications. Moreover, we enable novel reasoning principles such as expectation-preserving error composition, amortized error reasoning, and proving almost-sure termination by induction on the error. We illustrate the advantages of our approach by proving amortized error bounds on a range of examples, including collision probabilities in hash functions, which allows us to write more modular specifications for data structures that use them as clients. We also use our logic to prove correctness and almost-sure termination of rejection sampling algorithms.

Such disturbances are often modeled as process noise in a dynamical system, and common assumptions are that the underlying distributions are known and/or Gaussian. In practice, however, these assumptions may be unrealistic and can lead to poor approximations of the true noise distribution. We present a novel controller synthesis method that does not rely on any explicit representation of the noise distributions. In particular, we address the problem of computing a controller that provides probabilistic guarantees on safely reaching a target, while also avoiding unsafe regions of the state space. First, we abstract the continuous control system into a finite-state model that captures noise by probabilistic transitions between discrete states. As a key contribution, we adapt tools from the scenario approach to compute probably approximately correct ({PAC}) bounds on these transition probabilities, based on a finite number of samples of the noise. We capture these bounds in the transition probability intervals of a so-called interval Markov decision process ({iMDP}). This {iMDP} is, with a user-specified confidence probability, robust against uncertainty in the transition probabilities, and the tightness of the probability intervals can be controlled through the number of samples. We use state-of-the-art verification techniques to provide guarantees on the {iMDP} and compute a controller for which these guarantees carry over to the original control system. In addition, we develop a tailored computational scheme that reduces the complexity of the synthesis of these guarantees on the {iMDP}. Benchmarks on realistic control systems show the practical applicability of our method, even when the {iMDP} has hundreds of millions of transitions.},\r\n author = {Badings, Thom and Romao, Licio and Abate, Alessandro and Parker, David and Poonawala, Hasan A. and Stoelinga, Marielle and Jansen, Nils},\r\n date = {2023-01-21},\r\n doi = {10.1613/jair.1.14253},\r\n file = {Full Text PDF:/home/eigil/Zotero/storage/4KYNP6D2/Badings et al. - 2023 - Robust Control for Dynamical Systems with Non-Gaus.pdf:application/pdf},\r\n issn = {1076-9757},\r\n journaltitle = {Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research},\r\n keywords = {markov decision processes, probabilistic reasoning, uncertainty},\r\n langid = {english},\r\n pages = {341--391},\r\n rights = {Copyright (c) 2023 Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research},\r\n title = {Robust Control for Dynamical Systems with Non-Gaussian Noise via Formal Abstractions},\r\n url = {https://jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/14253},\r\n urldate = {2024-03-06},\r\n volume = {76}\r\n}","doi":"10.1613/Jair.1.14253","url":"Https://jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/14253"}},"zennaro_abstraction_2022":{"title":"Abstraction between structural causal models: A review of definitions and properties","taxon":"Reference","tags":[],"route":"zennaro_abstraction_2022.xml","metas":{"bibtex":"@Misc{zennaro_abstraction_2022,\r\n abstract = {Structural causal models ({SCMs}) are a widespread formalism to deal with causal systems.

Here, we argue that compositionality is a desideratum for such model transformations and the associated errors: When abstracting a reference model M iteratively, first obtaining M' and then further simplifying that to obtain M'', we expect the composite transformation from M to M'' to exist and its error to be bounded by the errors incurred by each individual transformation step.

In the context of automatic abstraction, generalized model checking means checking whether there exists a concretization of an abstraction that satis es a temporal logic formula. In this paper, we show how generalized model checking can extend existing automatic abstraction techniques (such as predicate abstraction) for model checking concurrent/reactive programs and yield the three following improvements: (1) any temporal logic formula can be checked (not just universal properties as with traditional conservative abstractions), (2) correctness proofs and counter-examples are both guaranteed to be sound, and (3) veri cation results can be more precise. We study the cost needed to improve precision by presenting new upper and lower bounds for the complexity of generalized model checking in the size of the abstraction.},\r\n author = {Godefroid, Patrice and Jagadeesan, Radha},\r\n booktitle = {Computer Aided Verification},\r\n date = {2002},\r\n doi = {10.1007/3-540-45657-0_11},\r\n editor = {Brinksma, Ed and Larsen, Kim Guldstrand},\r\n editorb = {Goos, Gerhard and Hartmanis, Juris and Van Leeuwen, Jan},\r\n editorbtype = {redactor},\r\n file = {Godefroid and Jagadeesan - 2002 - Automatic Abstraction Using Generalized Model Chec.pdf:/home/eigil/Zotero/storage/E9PFXZKQ/Godefroid and Jagadeesan - 2002 - Automatic Abstraction Using Generalized Model Chec.pdf:application/pdf},\r\n isbn = {978-3-540-43997-4 978-3-540-45657-5},\r\n langid = {english},\r\n location = {Berlin, Heidelberg},\r\n note = {Series Title: Lecture Notes in Computer Science},\r\n pages = {137--151},\r\n publisher = {Springer Berlin Heidelberg},\r\n title = {Automatic Abstraction Using Generalized Model Checking},\r\n url = {http://link.springer.com/10.1007/3-540-45657-0_11},\r\n urldate = {2024-03-31},\r\n volume = {2404}\r\n}","doi":"10.1007/3-540-45657-0_11","url":"Http://link.springer.com/10.1007/3-540-45657-0_11"}},"myers-cst":{"title":"Categorical Systems Theory","taxon":"Reference","tags":[],"route":"myers-cst.xml","metas":{"bibtex":"@article\n{Myers, title={Categorical Systems Theory}, author={Myers, David Jaz},language={en} }","external":"Http://davidjaz.com/Papers/DynamicalBook.pdf"}},"eigil-rischel":{"title":"Eigil Fjeldgren Rischel","taxon":"Person","tags":[],"route":"eigil-rischel.xml","metas":{"external":"Https://www.erischel.com/"}},"macros":{"title":"Macros","taxon":null,"tags":[],"route":"macros.xml","metas":{}}}
