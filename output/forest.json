However, decision-makers are often faced with multiple related problems and multi-scale observations where joint formulations are needed in order to efficiently exploit the problem structures and data dependencies. Transfer learning for {CMABs} addresses the situation where models are defined on identical variables, although causal connections may differ. In this work, we extend transfer learning to setups involving {CMABs} defined on potentially different variables, with varying degrees of granularity, and related via an abstraction map. Formally, we introduce the problem of causally abstracted {MABs} ({CAMABs}) by relying on the theory of causal abstraction in order to express a rigorous abstraction map. We propose algorithms to learn in a {CAMAB}, and study their regret.

Such disturbances are often modeled as process noise in a dynamical system, and common assumptions are that the underlying distributions are known and/or Gaussian. In practice, however, these assumptions may be unrealistic and can lead to poor approximations of the true noise distribution. We present a novel controller synthesis method that does not rely on any explicit representation of the noise distributions. In particular, we address the problem of computing a controller that provides probabilistic guarantees on safely reaching a target, while also avoiding unsafe regions of the state space. First, we abstract the continuous control system into a finite-state model that captures noise by probabilistic transitions between discrete states. As a key contribution, we adapt tools from the scenario approach to compute probably approximately correct ({PAC}) bounds on these transition probabilities, based on a finite number of samples of the noise. We capture these bounds in the transition probability intervals of a so-called interval Markov decision process ({iMDP}). This {iMDP} is, with a user-specified confidence probability, robust against uncertainty in the transition probabilities, and the tightness of the probability intervals can be controlled through the number of samples. We use state-of-the-art verification techniques to provide guarantees on the {iMDP} and compute a controller for which these guarantees carry over to the original control system. In addition, we develop a tailored computational scheme that reduces the complexity of the synthesis of these guarantees on the {iMDP}. Benchmarks on realistic control systems show the practical applicability of our method, even when the {iMDP} has hundreds of millions of transitions.},\n author = {Badings, Thom and Romao, Licio and Abate, Alessandro and Parker, David and Poonawala, Hasan A. and Stoelinga, Marielle and Jansen, Nils},\n date = {2023-01-21},\n doi = {10.1613/jair.1.14253},\n file = {Full Text PDF:/home/eigil/Zotero/storage/4KYNP6D2/Badings et al. - 2023 - Robust Control for Dynamical Systems with Non-Gaus.pdf:application/pdf},\n issn = {1076-9757},\n journaltitle = {Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research},\n keywords = {markov decision processes, probabilistic reasoning, uncertainty},\n langid = {english},\n pages = {341--391},\n rights = {Copyright (c) 2023 Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research},\n title = {Robust Control for Dynamical Systems with Non-Gaussian Noise via Formal Abstractions},\n url = {https://jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/14253},\n urldate = {2024-03-06},\n volume = {76}\n}","doi":"10.1613/Jair.1.14253","url":"Https://jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/14253"}},"zennaro_abstraction_2022":{"title":"Abstraction between structural causal models: A review of definitions and properties","taxon":"Reference","tags":[],"route":"zennaro_abstraction_2022.xml","metas":{"bibtex":"@Misc{zennaro_abstraction_2022,\n abstract = {Structural causal models ({SCMs}) are a widespread formalism to deal with causal systems.

Yet, it is difficult to formalise how we may change the underlying variables used to describe the system, say moving from fine-grained to coarse-grained variables. Here, we argue that compositionality is a desideratum for such model transformations and the associated errors: When abstracting a reference model M iteratively, first obtaining M' and then further simplifying that to obtain M'', we expect the composite transformation from M to M'' to exist and its error to be bounded by the errors incurred by each individual transformation step. Category theory, the study of mathematical objects via compositional transformations between them, offers a natural language to develop our framework for model transformations and abstractions.
